# Tennis analytics

In search of a reason for learning the mecanics of the R package keras, we became interested in predicting the outcome of tennis matches. The focus was initially put on predicting the winner of a given match, but that objective is now generalized to other statistics as well (duration, sets, aces, svpt, ...).

We are still trying to get signal using rnn's.
