# Tennis analytics

## About the project
The goal behind this repo is to (learn and) apply neural networks techniques on tennis data. More precisely,
we focus on the outcome of ATP matches.

(Present status)
We've just succeeded at fitting a first neural net using kerasR. We now focus on potential new variables and data structure.

## Modeling
This folder is all about model construction.

## Data
This folder contains the raw data and the R scripts that eventually import and clean tennis data from different sources.

## Visualisation
In this folder, we wish to provide different tools allowing insightful visualisations of the data/ATP (graphs, Shiny, etc.) as well as easier model interpretations.

## Dev
For the moment, this folder contains leftover files.
