# Preface

We just wanna know the performance of simple rule-based model that uses the ranks of the players only.

```{r import_data}
library(data.table)
data <- fread(input = "Data/Cleaned/DataGameByGame.csv")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
